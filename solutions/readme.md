Solutions for each exercise.

* Exercise 1

Download data from
https://github.com/neelsoumya/teaching_reproducible_science_R/blob/main/metagene_score.csv

and train a classifier to predict yes/no (flag_yes_no). This would be a binary classifier. Do this with cross-validation. Write your own R code to do this task. You can work in groups. Do this in class.

The data is also available here

* Exercise 2

Download data from

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult

and train a classifier to predict if income > 50K or < 50K (binary classifier). Do this with cross-validation. Write your own R code to do this task. You can work in groups. Do this in class.

The data is also available in the adult folder here

* Challenge exercise 3

How would you select the features that go in the logistic regression model?

Think of a brute force approach.

Can you think of a more sophisticated apporach?


For an advanced exercise use the `glmnet` package in R.
